# TensorFlow_Image_Classification
Image classification using tensor flow library.

Image CLassification can be done by making use of a Pre-trained CNN model called Inception , which was trained by Goolge on around 100k images.

In this project I've worked on this model to classify the images into 3 types: the popular characters from the DragonBall  
franchise : Goku , Vegeta and Trunks.

Prerequisites:

1) Tensor flow library can be insatlled on your machine from the souce: https://www.tensorflow.org/install/

2) Follow my Goolge drive link to download the required files:     https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14aA1C6LsuoegiEZ4xhRjHJU10A1Xx9TZ?usp=sharing

Classifying the image:

1) Extract the .zip file downloaded from my Google drive link.

2) Open the terminal in that folder.

3) We are gonna classify this image now:
